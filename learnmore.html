   <h1 align='center'><p style="font-family:courier;">Understanding Homelessness</p></h1>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">The U.S. Census Bureau's 2016 census reported that the poverty rate in the United States was 12.7%. An estimated 43.1 million
      Americans are living below the poverty line.
      <br><br>In New York City alone there were 1.7 million people living below the poverty line between 2011 and 2015; making the poverty
          rate about 20%. About 1 in 3 people living under the poverty line, are children. Poverty tends to concentrate in
          neighborhoods with underfunded schools, high rates of violence , high unemployment rates, substance abuse, and teen pregnancy.
          All of these factors result in perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.
          <br><br>The number of homeless people sleeping in shelters every night has increased by 85% over the last ten years.
           In June 2018, there were approximately 61,421 people in New York's shelters every night.
           Of those 61,421 people, 22,266 were children in families, 22,256 were adults with families, and 16,899 were single adults. While nearly 1 in 128 New Yorkers is homeless, only 1 in every 17 of these people seem visibly homeless.

           <br><br> Understanding homelessness also means understanding intersectionality. Homelessness affects African-Americans and Latinx individuales disproportionately. Of the people in shelters 57% are African-American, 31% are latinx, 8% are white, and 4% are of unknown ethnicity. The majority of homeless people are also living with mental illness and other health conditions.
         <br><br>
                  The main cause of homelessness in New York is unaffordable housing. About 60% of New Yorkers do not have enough money for an emergency payment of about three months rent.
           Other major reasons includes - eviction, doubled-up or severely overcrowded housing, domestic violence, job loss, and hazardous housing conditions.</p>
