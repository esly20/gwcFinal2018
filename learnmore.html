    <h2 align='center'>Understanding Homelessness</h2>
    <p>  The U.S. Census Bureau's 2016 census reported that the poverty rate in the United States was 12.7%. An estimated 43.1 million 
      Americans are living below the poverty line.
      In New York City alone there were 1.7 million people living below the povetry line between 2011 and 2015; making the poverty 
      rate about 20%. About 1 in 3 people living under the poverty line, are children. Poverty tends to be concentrated in 
      neighborhoods with low-performing schools, high rates of violence, unemployment, substance abuse, and teen pregnancy. 
      All of these factors result in perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.
      The number of homeless people sleeping in shelters has increased by 85% over the last ten years.
       In June 2018, there were approximately 61,421 people in Shelters every night in New York City alone.
       Of those 61,421 people, 22,266 were children in families, 22,256 were adults with families, and 16,899 were single adults. While nearly 1 in 128 New Yorkers is homeless, only 1 in every 17 of these people seem visibaly homeless.

       The majority of homeless people are living with mental illness and other health conditions.
       African-Americans and latinx are disproportionately affected by homelessness.
       Of the people in shelters 57% are African-American, 31% are latinx, 8% are white, and 4% are of unkown ethnicity.
       The main cause of homelessness is unaffordable housing. Baout 60% of New Yorkers do not have enough money for an emergency payment of about three months rent.
       Other major reasons includes - eviction, doubled-up or severely overcrowded housing, domestic violence, job loss, and hazardous housing conditions.</p>
