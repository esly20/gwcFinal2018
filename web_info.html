  <p style='color:green;' style="font-family:verdana;">Due to me starting this website on a whim, I had no idea as to what to do with it. As I am wriitng this small paragraph, I am sitting at my chair with a cup suctioned to my mouth. Back to my distress of not having a flipping clue as to what I wanted to dedicate this to; here's the story of how BUFFALOS came to be.</p>
  <p style='color:green;' style="font-family:verdana;">SOOO... as I was in quite a distress, I call over Christina, the GOAT, and the answer was "small buffalos". That's what she said; so there's the kinda short story of how BUFFALOS came to be...It's actually a very short story. Well, enjoy!</p>
  <p style='color:green;' style="font-family:verdana;">Enjoy the video, despite  it not being about buffalos.</p>
